Customers get access to the following products with a Free, Standard, or Business plan:  

* [Integrations](https://segment.com/integrations): Segment can send data to more than 180 marketing and analytics tools. Rather than instrumenting tracking code for each tool, companies track their data once with Segment’s event collection libraries. They can simply enable tools in their dashboard, and Segment sends that data to each tool in the format they understand.
