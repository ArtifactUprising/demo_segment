## Track Analysis: 

Track Analysis looks at “events” or “actions” such as a ≠≠button clicks. Track analysis uses events from the Tracks table only to define sessions. This is good for implementations where page views from the Pages table are not important for the customer , for instance  mobile apps where page view data is not very relevant.

For Track Analysis, refer to the tracks model and the numbered View Files (ex. 1_, 2_, 3_...) in the Segment Block.
